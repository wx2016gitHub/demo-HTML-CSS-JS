This demo application is to verify basic HTML/HTML5, CSS/CSS3 and JavaScript functionality. 
It includes five sections: audio, video, animation, photo and Form. 
I tried to use as many popular HTML tags and CSS definition's properties.
In this demo application, some attributes are removed by me in purpose because 
I just want to show how to using new HTML5 and CSS3 and don't want to make trouble to any website. 
And so do other demo application.
The page design is concerned less memory, simple and clear for this demo application.
All the photos, videos, pictures are taken or edited by myself. The audio and songs are down load from public free websites.
All the codes were tested on the chrome or IE.  It maybe causes some problems by different browser versions or PC settings.
